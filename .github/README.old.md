## Installation

 - `npm install @material-table/core`
 - `yarn add @material-table/core`

Instead of using `material-table` for `import` statements, use `@material-table/core`. Simply change your import statements.

```javascript
// This
import MaterialTable from "material-table";
// would become
import MaterialTable /*, { MTableBodyRow, etc.. } */ from '@material-table/core'; 
```

## Why?

Over the past 8 months or so, `material-table` has been less than responsive. `material-table` appears to be slowly going away (nobody seems to be maintaining it anymore) and I was tired of spending my own time submitting PR's with no response. I have also [seen](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues/1896) others [express](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues/1217) concern about this.

I even [asked to help them out](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues/1171) but was ignored, thus this fork was born.

## Intent

My intent is not to rip off `material-table`. **I do not plan on making any dramatic changes to the codebase.** 

Recently, [I have been very active](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+commenter%3Aoze4) in assisting with issues, most of the solutions to these issues are hacky and could be easily resolved within the codebase. Occassionally, the solution is as simple as updating/improving the docs.

## Goals

My main goals include chipping away at the [746 open issues](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/issues) and [69 open pull requests](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table/pulls), update documentation, [and make minor improvements](#demo) that help us all.

I want to keep things as close to they are now so that if the author of `material-table`, [Mehmet Baran](https://twitter.com/baranmehmet), ever wants to merge this code, we could easily do that. I would gladly provide ownership of the [npm organization](https://docs.npmjs.com/orgs/), [@material-table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-table/core), to him if he ever wanted to publish packages using this name.


## Want to help?

Gladly accepting "applications" :) ..but seriously, my goal is to be responsive (thanks COVID). I have no issue giving access/permission to those that wish to help improve this excellent product!
